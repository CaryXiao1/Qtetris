# Qtetris

Qtetris is a simplified, Python-based Tetris client that enables both players and an Q-learning model to compete against each other to find out how many points different players and the model can achieve in a given number of moves. This was co-created by CaryXiao1 and console-beaver as a final project for CS 238 at Stanford University.
